Exercise: Rewrite readlines to store lines in an array supplied by main, rather
than calling alloc to maintain storage. How much faster is the program?

Answer: Both versions of the program averaged 0.080 seconds to run, after
running an arbitrary number of measurements via the bash time command.

I think these results might not be wholly accurate for a few reasons:

 - The compiler may have optimized the code, causing both programs to run
   similarly.

 - The version of bash used was from Git-for-Windows, meaning that the time
   command may not work the same or be as accurate as it would be natively.

 - My modern laptop may be so fast that the time difference is very slight and
   difficult to detect without high precision measurements.

If any passing readers know of a more precise way to measure an executable's run
time on Windows, let me know, because I had trouble finding a one. Maybe even
some way to count the number of CPU cycles a program uses?
